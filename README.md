# SQL Server to Power BI – Bike Sales & Profit Analytics

## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents an **end-to-end business intelligence solution** built using **Microsoft SQL Server (SSMS)** and **Power BI** to analyze **sales, revenue, profit, and rider behavior** for a bike company (Toman Bike Shop).

Raw Excel data from multiple years was imported into SQL Server, transformed using SQL queries, and visualized through an interactive Power BI dashboard.
